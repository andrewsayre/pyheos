# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

## Set up development environment

This reposity uses Visual Studio Code with devcontainers. This is the easiest way to get started with development.

## Style

This repository uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code style and formatting. Commits and pull requests are automatically linted and checked using Ruff and must pass in order to be accepted.

_Save time by checking for style/lint issues **before** committing._:

```bash
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
.\script\lint.cmd
```

## Testing

All code is checked to verify:

- All the unit tests pass
- All code passes the checks from the linting tools
- Code coverage is maintained or improved without adding exclusions to `.coveragerc`

Unit tests can be ran outside of Tox by running:

```bash
pytest tests
```

To check the code coverage and determine which statements are not covered, run:

```bash
pytest tests --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. Follow the style and testing guidelines above
2. Fill out the pull request template and complete check-list activities
3. Submit a pull request and be responsive to questions and feedback

### Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

### Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-
requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add
or change.
